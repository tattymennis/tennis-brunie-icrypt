# tennis-brunie-icrypt
Simple multi-user telnet client/server encrypted messenger over Haskell

Made by Matthew Tennis & Romain Brunie

icrypt is an asynchronous client/server encrypted messenger application over Haskell built as a class project in Fall 2015.

The program allows for multiple concurrent connections to the server where a client is prompted to select a simple mono- or poly-alphabetic cipher as an encryption cipher.

All other clients connected to the server can enter an integer representing the shift value key of the cipher, and thus decrypt the message.

The state of this project is incomplete; the assignment was focused more on building a non-trivial application in Haskell rather than rigorous cryptography or production-level client/server architecture.

As such, this program is incomplete and is being hosted for legacy purposes.
